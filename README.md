*Please bear with me as I improve my skills and proficiency with coding programs.*

### My name is Joseph Boumoussa, and I am currently a student at Pace University.

##### I am enrolled in the Fast Track Combined Degree Program, where I am earning a B.S. in Business Economics and an M.S. in Applied Econometrics and Policy Analysis. My Expected graduation date is December 2023.




 ðŸ”­ I am extremely passionate about Research and Economics, but my hobbies and interests extend far beyond any reasonable association. 
 
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about cosmetic chemistry through independant study.
