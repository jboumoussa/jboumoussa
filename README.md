# :moon: Greetings & Salutations :black_cat:

*Please bear with me as I improve my skills and proficiency with coding programs.*

### My name is Joseph Boumoussa, and I am currently a student at Pace University.

##### I am enrolled in the Fast Track Combined Degree Program, where I am earning a B.S. in Business Economics and an M.S. in Applied Econometrics and Policy Analysis. My Expected graduation date is December 2023.

 🔭 I am extremely passionate about Research and Economics, but my hobbies and interests extend far beyond any reasonable association. 
 
🌱 I’m currently learning about cosmetic chemistry through independant study. I am particularly interested in dismantling the "appeal to nature" fallacy, and fostering a comprehensive understading of the fuctions of the skin. 

🖌️ To satisfy my more creative nature, I am continuing to work on my art show "Smoke & Lillies." The Show consists of six large paintings, one bas-relief, 1 digital art piece, and 1 installation. The show has been subject to many delays due to time constraints, but I am hoping to debut all of the works before I graduate. 

######My ultimate goal in life is to be happy. To achieve this, I have chosen a field that stimulates my mind and expands the field of my creativity. In truth, I could not imagine being as happy as I am now anywhere else. I invite you to enjoy this journey with me through my work.
